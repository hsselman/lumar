# lumar
Transform columns by example in R. When transforming a column of a dataset finding the right functions to transform is hard sometimes. Maybe you are inexperienced or just plain lazy. That should not matter. Find the right transformation for your column by entering examples of the result you are looking for. 

## Origin
The inspiration from this package came from a feature in PowerBI to transform a column by entering the result for examples and letting the software suggest possible transformations that give the proposed result. I personally think this will help new users find new ways to tranform their datasets. And also help advanced users to find a working transformation quick without the hassle.

## Why lumar?
The name `lumar` is inspired on a Nintendo character Luma. A star role for Luma is in Wii game Super Mario Galaxy. When fed enough star bits Luma transforms.
